# Java Architecture Patterns Generics

In this repository I need to make an implementation with Generics, and I have some goals

    ## Goals: 

    - Create different car classes
    - Create a list that can receive any type of cars 

For this project I decided to use two design patterns

    ## Design Patterns Used

    - **Behavior**:     Template Method
    - **Structural**:    Data Acess Object
